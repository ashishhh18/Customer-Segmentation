# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses understand their target audience better.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Common features: Age, Income, Spending Score, etc.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (K-Means)

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution.
3. **Clustering Techniques**: Applying K-Means and other clustering methods.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting clusters for insights.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook CustomerSegmentation.ipynb`

## Results
- Customers are grouped into different segments based on similarities.
- Insights can be used for targeted marketing strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Use advanced clustering techniques.
- Implement deep learning for better segmentation.
